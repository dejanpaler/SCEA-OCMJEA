<b>Dreamcar</b>
<br>
<br>Dreamcar is a successful car manufacturer with sales and 
distribution channels in the Asia-Pacific markets of South Korea, 
Australia, Malaysia, and Vietnam. However, the company plans to expand 
into three new markets over the next seven years - Japan, Western 
Europe, and North America. To do this, the company has identified a need
 to improve the build quality of completed cars and also the component 
quality. Initial procurement studies have predicted a cost saving of up 
to 30 percent  if Dreamcar can procure standard components, such as 
wheels, tires, suspension, brake discs, and pads using a reverse 
auctioneering application open to international participation rather 
than relying on local importers and a traditional procurement process.

<b>Workshop Output</b>
<br>You are the architect for the reverse auctioneering application at 
Dreamcar. You have been tasked by Dreamcar management to lead the team 
responsible for the design, implementation, and ongoing management of 
the complete system as a turnkey or complete solution. After an 
intensive series of discovery workshops with in-house business analysts 
and subject matter experts, you know the following facts:
<br>
<br>Dreamcar relies on a Just In Time (JIT) manufacturing process to reduce idle and out of date inventory within the company.
<br>Phase one of the application will focus on three main components – 
brake pads, brake discs, and suspension components, with additional part
 types coming in a later phase once the marketplace has successfully 
launched.
<br>Dreamcar has recently invested in a state of the art stock inventory
 system that predicts demand for components up to one month in advance 
so that orders for a specific marketplace can be manually placed into a 
reverse auctioneering application to get the best possible price for the
 parts required. This inventory system is accessed using a web services 
API.
<br>International participation in the reverse auctioneering application
 is proven to make similar marketplaces more competitive than purely 
local participation, but international companies must be satisfied that 
the marketplace mechanisms are both transparent and impartial, including
 the speed of any API integration mechanisms. Dreamcar has committed to a
 system uptime of 99.99 percent during core working hours (8 am – 8 pm 
GMT +7) and an average API response time of five (5) seconds or less for
 95 percent of all requests with a maximum response time of ten (10) 
seconds for all requests.
<br>
<br><b>Note on Reverse Auctions</b>
<br>A reverse auction is a method of procurement used by the procuring 
party to create more competition between potential suppliers for a given
 bid request. A reverse auction operates as follows:
<br>The procurer places a request for bids to supply an item or service with multiple potential suppliers;
<br>Interested suppliers make their best offer to supply the requested 
item or service – taking into account that they may not be the only 
supplier bidding and that they must be competitive in order to win the 
business;
<br>A reverse auction can be blind (none of the suppliers know what the 
other suppliers are bidding) or open (each supplier can review each 
other's bids and decide whether or not to outbid a competitor); and 
finally, after a pre-defined criteria is met (time period, price 
threshold met), the procuring party ends the auction and selects a 
winning supplier.
<br>
<br>Dreamcar intend to use the open method of reverse auctioning in this
 application in order to heighten inter-supplier competitiveness.
<br>
<br><b>Business Domain Model</b>
<br>The following business domain model describes the key objects 
identified during the workshops. All of these objects and the 
relationships between them should be addressed in your design and 
implementation.
<br><img name="15150277" src="1_files/15150277.JPG" alt="Comments" border="0">
<br>
<br><b>Use Case Diagrams</b>
<br>The following use case diagram captures the main use cases that must be supported by your proposed design and implementation.
<br><img name="15150278" src="1_files/15150278.JPG" alt="Comments" border="0">
<br>
<br>The use case specifications provided are a first pass at the use 
cases and provide enough detail in order for you to architect a 
solution. 
<br>
<br><b>Use Case Specification – Post Request for Parts</b>
<br>Brief Description
<br>The Post Request use case allows an authorized Dreamcar representative to place a request for a required quantity of parts.
<br>
<br>Basic Flow
<br>1. Dreamcar representative inputs a part category and quantity.
<br>2. System responds with a validation that the part and quantity is a valid bid request.
<br>3. The system makes the bid request status open so that bidders can view and bid for the request.
<br>
<br><b>Use Case Specification – Review Open Bids</b>
<br>Brief Description
<br>The Review Open Bids use case allows an authorized Dreamcar 
representative to review open bids placed in response to an open bid 
request.
<br>Basic Flow
<br>1. Dreamcar representative searches for open bids and selects one of interest.
<br>2. System responds with all bid requests relating to the selected bid request.
<br>
<br><b>Use Case Specification – Submit Bid for Open</b> Parts Request
<br>Brief Description
<br>The Submit Bid for Open Parts Request use case allows an authorized 
supplier to bid on open bid requests of interest that exist in the 
system.
<br>
<br>Basic Flow
<br>1. Supplier representative searches for open bid requests.
<br>2. System responds with all bid requests relating to the search criteria.
<br>3. Supplier representative selects open bid request of interest.
<br>4. Supplier representative places a bid for the open bid request.
<br>5. System records the supplier bid against the bid request.
<br>
<br><b>Use Case Specification – Issue PO to Winning</b> Bidder
<br>Brief Description
<br>The Issue PO to Winning Bidder use case allows a Dreamcar 
representative to select a winning bid for a specific bid request and 
issue a PO to the supplier associated with that bid.
<br>
<br>Basic Flow
<br>1. Dreamcar representative searches for closed bid requests.
<br>2. System responds with all bid requests relating to the search criteria.
<br>3. Dreamcar representative selects closed bid request of interest.
<br>4. Dreamcar representative reviews all bids to ensure that the most valid bid has been chosen.
<br>5. Dreamcar representative accepts the most suitable bid.
<br>6. The system issues a PO to the winning supplier.
<br>
<br><b>Use Case Specification – Schedule Work in Factory</b>
<br>Brief Description
<br>The Schedule Work in Factory use case allows an authorized Dreamcar 
representative to schedule work in the car assembly plant, which  relies
 on the successful bid requests placed with suppliers in the auction 
system.
<br>
<br>Basic Flow
<br>1. Dreamcar representative searches for closed bid requests with a PO raised.
<br>2. System responds with all bid requests relating to the search criteria.
<br>3. Dreamcar representative selects the bid of interest.
<br>4. Dreamcar representative changes the status of the bid to “scheduled.”
<br>5. System sends the bid details to the inventory system so that the work  that relies on the parts request can now be scheduled.
<br>
<br>
<br><b> Deliverables</b>
<br>It is your task to create an architecture and design for the System 
under Development (SuD) with the given business domain model, 
information provided above and requirements in the use cases. The 
architecture must be based on the Java™ Platform, Enterprise Edition 
(Java EE) platform1.  All deliverables will be accepted as HTML only and
 each diagram must be UML compliant.
<br>
<br>1. Create a class diagram for the SuD. Public method names 
referenced in other UML diagrams (for example, sequence diagrams) should
 be provided.
<br>2. Create a Component diagram for the SuD showing the components 
used in the system and their interaction. Examples of components are 
Enterprise JavaBean™ (EJB™), servlets, JavaServer™ Pages (JSP™), major 
Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs), and important Managers / Controllers / 
Design Pattern implementations.
<br>3. Create a Deployment diagram that describes the proposed physical layout of the major tiers of the SuD.
<br>4.Create either a Sequence or Collaboration diagram for each use case provided.
<br>5. List the top three technical risks you have identified in the project and identify a mitigation strategy for each risk.
<br>6. List any assumptions made during the process of coming up with 
the architecture and design that have a material impact on your design 
and any decisions made in arriving at that design.
<br>Your architecture and design will be graded on how well it supports 
the requirements detailed in this document and on the clarity of all 
information provided in both textual and diagrammatic form.
<br>
<br><b> Submitting Your Work</b>
<br>Note to the candidate: Failure to follow the rules described here 
will result in an immediate failure and require a re-submission on your 
part.
<br>When you have completed your solution, you should have an 
"index.html" that has your name, ID, a link to the class, component, and
 deployment diagrams, risk list, and a link to each of the 
sequence/collaboration diagrams. Build a JAR archive that contains all 
html files. You must build a JAR archive; do not send individual files.
<br>The name of your submission JAR archive file MUST be derived from 
your testing ID.  Your archive file name MUST BE scea-AAAAAAAAA.jar, 
where AAAAAAAAA is your testing ID.
